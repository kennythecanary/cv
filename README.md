# Dmitry Ilyushkin Data Science Portfolio

This is the list of projects I worked on or currently working on. 

## Contents

- ### Online Education Courses

  Repository contains my coursework in specialization I completed. Tools: Numpy, Scipy, Pandas, Sklearn, XGBoost, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

  - [Churn Model](https://github.com/kennythecanary/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/coursera/churn_prediction): A binary classification model that reveals customers tend to churn. Repository includes the [code](https://github.com/kennythecanary/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/coursera/churn_prediction/churn_kaggle_prediction.ipynb) for Kaggle [competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/telecom-clients-prediction2) I participated in and the [final report](https://github.com/kennythecanary/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/coursera/churn_prediction/churn_final_report.ipynb) of the research.

- ### Data Analysis and Visualisation

  - #### Python

    - [Steelmaking Process Analysis](https://github.com/kennythecanary/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/data_visualization/steelmaking/steelmaking_viz.ipynb): Stats tests and visualizations that aim to show main stages of the steelmaking process and their impact on a defect rate.  
    - [Admission Statistics](https://github.com/kennythecanary/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/data_visualization/admission/pulling_data.ipynb): Python code for parsing, processing and visualization admission statistics of [BSTU](https://www.tu-bryansk.ru/abiturient/).

  - #### R

    - [Optimization of Process Parameters Using GRA](https://rpubs.com/kennythecanary/gra_laser_welding): Laser welding parameters optimization by the use of Grey Relational Grade as the performance index.
    
    - [A Sample Paper on a Discipline Base of Experiment Theory](https://rpubs.com/kennythecanary/uksim_paper): Examples of training task solving connected with scientific designs and statistics.

- ### Tests

  - [Google Sheets and Pivot Tables](https://github.com/kennythecanary/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/test/macbuildserver/data_analyst_test.ipynb): Task for Data Analysts at MacBuildSercer.
  
  - [Next Order](https://github.com/kennythecanary/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/test/sbermarket/next_order.ipynb): Sbermarket internship [—Åompetition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/sbermarket-internship-competition/) on Kaggle. The point is to predict next orders by the use of users ID, types of goods and purchase dates. 

- ### SQL statements

  - [SELECT (learning stage)](https://github.com/kennythecanary/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/SQL_exercises/learning_stage): My solutions of the exercises of the learning stage from SQL-ex.ru.
